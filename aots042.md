questions, comments or concerns regarding any of the proposals listed
please post them to the OpenType discussion mailing list.

## Proposing new features

### Specification

Microsoft and Adobe welcome nominations for new features and feature
tags. To qualify for registration, a feature must have a single function
that is clearly identified by its tag. The function of the feature
should be defined at the lowest useful level and must be distinctly
different from the functions of currently registered features. When font
developers register feature tags and functions with Microsoft, they do
not have to supply implementation details.

To submit a proposal please e-mail the following information to
ttwsite@microsoft.com. See the current registered features for example
wording.

  - Tag

  - Friendly name

  - Registered by

  - Status

  - Function

  - Example

  - Recommended implementation

  - Application interface

  - UI suggestion

  - Script/language sensitivity

  - Feature interaction

Providing the proposal raises no serious concerns we will post it here
for review. After a further period of review the status of the proposal
will be updated to indicate if the proposed feature has been accepted or
rejected. Accepted proposals will be added to the OpenType registered
features list when the OpenType specification is next updated.
