  <section role="specification">
    <para>This specification details the format of CommonType fonts,
          the TrueType and CFF outline formats, and the TrueType
          hinting language. This document derives from Adobe's
          <link xlink:href="https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/aots">Annotated
          OpenType Specification</link>, a libre-licensed edition of the
          OpenType Specification version 1.4. The OpenType Specification was
          developed jointly by Adobe and Microsoft. Because OpenType is
          itself an extension of TrueType, there is also information in
          this document that was originally authored by Apple.</para>
    <para>Many references to both TrueType and PostScript exist
          throughout this document, as CommonType fonts combine the two
          technologies.</para>
    <remark>
          <para>This specification is an editor's draft. It does not
          necessarily represent the consensus of the CommonType committee.
