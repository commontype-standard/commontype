      <para>In many cases, we do not care to specify the format
	  which should be used to represent a coverage, but instead
	  would prefer the compiler to figure out the best
	  representation. For this purpose, we use the observation in
	  our annotations, and represent two attributes:
	  <sgmltag>format</sgmltag> with the value
	  <sgmltag>any</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>glyphs</sgmltag> to hold
	  the list of covered glyphs:</para>
