      <para>In the XML representation, the various entries can occur in any order, and the long and short metrics can even be interleaved. However, the entries must have distinct gid attribute values, and collectively cover exactly the range [0, n-1]. In a fully valid font, n must of course be equal to the maxp.numGlyphs.</para>
