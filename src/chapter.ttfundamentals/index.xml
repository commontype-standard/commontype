	File format.</para>
      <para>This chapter introduces the basic concepts needed to
	create and instruct a TrueType font, or an CommonType font that
	contains TrueType outline data. It begins with an overview of
	the steps involved in taking a design from paper to the
	creation of a bitmap that can be sent to an output device and
	follows with a closer look at each of the steps in the
	process.</para>

      <para>A TrueType font can originate as a new design drawn on
	paper or created on a computer screen. TrueType fonts can also
	be obtained by converting fonts from other formats. Whatever
	the case, it is necessary to create a TrueType font file that,
	among other things, describes each glyph in the font as an
	outline in the TrueType format.</para>

      <para>This section describes the coordinate system used to
	establish the locations of the points that define a glyph
	outline. It also documents the placement of glyphs with
	respect to the coordinate axes.</para>
      <bridgehead>Outlines</bridgehead>
      <para>In a TrueType font, glyph shapes are described by their
	outlines. A glyph outline consists of a series of contours. A
	simple glyph may have only one contour. More complex glyphs
	can have two or more contours. Composite glyphs can be
	constructed by combining two or more simpler glyphs. Certain
	control characters that have no visible manifestation will map
	to the glyph with no contours.</para>

	    respectively</title>

      <para>Contours are composed of straight lines and
	curves. Curves are defined by a series of points that describe
	second order Bezier-splines. The TrueType Bezier-spline format
	uses two types of points to define curves, those that are on
	the curve and those that are off the curve. Any combination of
	off and on curve points is acceptable when defining a
	curve. Straight lines are defined by two consecutive on curve
	points.</para>

      <para>The points that make up a curve must be numbered in
	consecutive order. It makes a difference whether the order is
	increasing or decreasing in determining the fill pattern of
	the shapes that make up the glyph. The direction of the curves
	has to be such that, if the curve is followed in the direction
	of increasing point numbers, the black space (the filled area)
	will always be to the right.</para>
      <bridgehead><glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s and the em square</bridgehead>
      <para>In a TrueType font file point locations are described in
	font units, or <glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s. An <glossterm>font unit</glossterm> is the smallest measurable
	unit in the em square, an imaginary square that is used to
	size and align glyphs. The dimensions of the em square
	typically are those of the full body height of a font plus
	some extra spacing to prevent lines of text from colliding
	when typeset without extra leading.</para>

      </informalfigure>
      <para>While in the days of metal type, glyphs could not extend
	beyond the em square, digital typefaces are not so
	constrained. The em square may be made large enough to
	completely contain all glyphs, including accented glyphs. Or,
	if it proves convenient, portions of glyphs may extend outside
	the em square. TrueType fonts can handle either approach so
	the choice is that of the font manufacturer. Figure 1-3 A
	character that extends outside of the em square</para>

      </informalfigure>
      <para>The em square defines a two-dimensional coordinate grid
	whose x-axis describes movement in a horizontal direction and
	whose y-axis describes movement in a vertical direction. This
	is discussed in more detail in the following section.</para>
      <bridgehead><glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s and the grid</bridgehead>
      <para>A key decision in digitizing a font is determining the
	resolution at which the points that make up glyph outlines
	will be described. The points represent locations in a grid
	whose smallest addressable unit is known as an <glossterm>font unit</glossterm> or font
	Unit. The grid is a two-dimensional coordinate system whose
	x-axis describes movement in a horizontal direction and whose
	y-axis describes movement in a vertical direction. The grid
	origin has the coordinates (0,0). The grid is not an infinite
	plane. Each point must be within the range -16384 and +16383
	<glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s. Depending upon the resolution chosen, the range of
	addressable grid locations will be smaller.</para>
      <para>The choice of the granularity of the coordinate
	grid-that is, number of units per em (upem)-is made by the
	font manufacturer. Outline scaling will be fastest if units
	per em is chosen to be a power of 2, such as 2048.</para>

      </figure>
      <para>The origin of the em square need not have any consistent
	relationship to the glyph outlines. In practice, however,
	applications depend upon the existence of some convention for
	the placement of glyphs for a given font. For Roman fonts,
	which are intended to be laid out horizontally, a y-coordinate
	value of 0 typically is assumed to correspond to the baseline
	of the font. No particular meaning is assigned to an
	x-coordinate of 0 but manufacturers may improve the
	performance of applications by choosing a standard meaning for
	the x-origin.</para>
      <para>For example, you might place a glyph so that its
	aesthetic center is at the x-coordinate value of 0. That is, a
	set of glyphs so designed when placed in a column such that
	their x-coordinate values of 0 are coincident will appear to
	be nicely centered. This option would be used for Kanji or any
	fonts that are typeset vertically. Another alternative is to
	place each glyph so that its leftmost extreme outline point
	has an x-value equal to the left-side-bearing of the
	glyph. Fonts created in this way may allow some applications
	to print more quickly to PostScript printers.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Figure 1-5 Two possible choices for the glyph origin
	  in a Roman font. In the first case (left) the left side
	  bearing is x-zero. In the second (right), the aesthetic
	  center of the character is x-zero</title>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="../../img00297.gif"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>Non-Roman fonts may wish to use other conventions for
	the meaning of the x-origin and y-origin. For best results
	with high-lighting and carets, the body of the character
	should be roughly centered within the advance width. For
	example, a symmetrical character would have equal left and
	right side bearings.</para>
      <para>The granularity of the em square is determined by the
	number of <glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s per em, or more simply units per em . The em
	square as divided into <glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s defines a coordinate system with
	one unit equaling an <glossterm>font unit</glossterm>. All points defined in this
	coordinate system must have integral locations. The greater
	the number of units per em, the greater the precision
	available in addressing locations within the em square.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Figure 1-6 Two em squares, 8 units per em (left), 16
          units per em (right) </title>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para><glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s are relative units because they vary in size as
	the size of the em square changes. The number of units per em
	remains constant for a given font regardless of the point
	size. The number of points per em, however, will vary with the
	point size of a glyph. An em square is exactly 9 points high
	when a glyph is displayed at 9 points, exactly 10 points high
	when the font is displayed at 10 point, and so on. Since the
	number of units per em does not vary with the point size at
	which the font is displayed, the absolute size of an <glossterm>font unit</glossterm>
	varies as the point size varies.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Figure 1-7 72 point M and 127 point M and their em
	    squares. Upem equals 8 in both cases.</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>Because <glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s are relative to the em square, a given
	location on a glyph will have the same coordinate location in
	<glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s regardless of the point size at which the font is
	rendered. This is convenient because it makes it possible to
	instruct outline points once considering only the original
	outline and have the changes apply to the glyph at whatever
	size and resolution it is ultimately rendered.</para>

    <title>Scaling a glyph</title>
    <!--____________________________________________________________________-->
    <section role="specification">
      <title>Specification</title>
      <para>This section describes how glyph outlines are scaled
	from the master size stored in the font file to the size
	requested by an application.</para>
      <bridgehead>Device space</bridgehead>
      <para>Whatever the resolution of the em square used to define
	a glyph outline, before that glyph can be displayed it must be
	scaled to reflect the size, transformation and the
	characteristics of the output device on which it is to be
	displayed. The scaled outline must describe the character
	outline in units that reflect an absolute rather than relative
	system of measurement. In this case the points that make up a
	glyph outline are described in terms of pixels.</para>
      <para>Intuitively, pixels are the actual output bits that will
	appear on screen or printer. To allow for greater precision in
	managing outlines, TrueType describes pixel coordinates to the
	nearest sixty-fourth of a pixel.</para>
      <bridgehead>Converting <glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s to pixels</bridgehead>
      <para>Values in the em square are converted to values in the
	pixel coordinate system by multiplying them by a scale. This
	scale is:</para>
      <para>pointSize * resolution / ( 72 points per inch *
	units_per_em )</para>
      <para>where pointSize is the size at which the glyph is to be
	displayed, and resolution is the resolution of the output
	device. The 72 in the denominator reflects the number of
	points per inch.</para>
      <para>For example, assume that a glyph feature is 550 <glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s
	in length on a 72 dpi screen at 18 point. There are 2048 units
	per em. The following calculation reveals that the feature is
	4.83 pixels long.</para>
      <para>550 * 18 * 72 / ( 72 * 2048 ) = 4.83</para>
      <bridgehead>Display device characteristics</bridgehead>
      <para>The resolution of any particular display device is
	specified by the number of dots or pixels per inch (dpi) that
	are displayed. For example, a VGA under Windows is treated as
	a 96 dpi device, and most laser printers have a resolution of
	300 dpi. Some devices, such as an EGA, have different
	resolution in the horizontal and vertical directions
	(i.e. non-square pixels); in the case of the EGA this
	resolution is 96 x 72. In such cases, horizontal dots per inch
	must be distinguished from vertical dots per inch.</para>
      <para>The number of pixels per em is dependent on the
	resolution of the output device. An 18 point character will
	have 18 pixels per em on a 72 dpi device. Change the
	resolution to 300 dpi and it has 75 pixels per em, or change
	to 1200 dpi and it has 300 pixels per em.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Figure 1-8 18 point figure 8 at 72 dpi, 300 dpi and 1200 dpi.</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>Displaying type on a particular device at a specific
	point size yields an effective resolution measured in pixels
	per em (ppem). The formula for calculating pixels per em
	is:</para>
      <para>ppem = pointSize * dpi / 72</para>
      <para>= (pixels per inch) * (inches per pica point) * (pica
	points per em)</para>
      <para>= dpi * 1 / 72 * pointSize</para>
      <para>On a 300 dpi laser printer, a 12 point glyph would have
	12*300/72 or 50 ppem. On a typesetter with 2400 dpi, it would
	have 12*2400/72 or 400 ppem. On a VGA, a 12 point glyph would
	have 12*96/72 or 16 ppem. Similarly, the ppem for a 12 point
	character on a 72 dpi device would be 12*72/72, or 12. This
	last calculation points to a useful rule of thumb: on any 72
	dpi device, points and pixels per em are equal. Note, however,
	that in traditional typography an inch contains 72.2752 points
	(rather than 72); that is, one point equals .013836
	inches.</para>
      <para>If you know the ppem, the formula to convert between
	<glossterm>font unit</glossterm>s and pixel space coordinates is:</para>
      <para>pixel_coordinate = em_coordinate * ppem /upem</para>
      <para>An em_coordinate position of (1024, 0) would yield a
	device_pixels coordinate of (6, 0), given 2048 units per em
	and 12 pixels per em.</para>

    <title>Grid-fitting a glyph outline</title>
    <!--____________________________________________________________________-->
    <section role="specification">
      <title>Specification</title>
      <para>The fundamental task of instructing a glyph is one of
	identifying the critical characteristics of the original
	design and using instructions to ensure that those
	characteristics will be preserved when the glyph is rendered
	at different sizes on different devices. Consistent stem
	weights, consistent color, even spacing, and the elimination
	of pixel dropouts are common goals.</para>
      <para>To accomplish these goals, it is necessary to ensure
	that the correct pixels are turned on when a glyph is
	rasterized. It is the pixels that are turned on that create
	the bitmap image of the glyph. Since it is the shape of the
	glyph outline that determines which pixels will make up the
	bitmap image of that character at a given size, it is
	sometimes necessary to change or distort the original outline
	description to produce a high quality image. This distortion
	of the outline is known as grid-fitting.</para>
      <para>The figure below illustrates how grid-fitting a
	character distorts the outline found in the original design.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Figure 1-9 12 point outlines ungrid-fitted (left) and
          grid-fitted (right) </title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>As the illustration above suggests, the grid-fitting
	employed in TrueType goes well beyond aligning a glyph's left
	side bearing to the pixel grid. This sophisticated
	grid-fitting is guided by instructions. The beneficial effects
	of grid-fitting are illustrated in the next figure.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Figure 1-10 12 point outlines and bitmap
	    ungrid-fitted (left) and grid-fitted (right)</title>
        <mediaobject>

            <imagedata fileref="../../img00305.gif"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>Grid-fitting is the process of stretching the outline of
	a glyph according to the instructions associated with it. Once
	a glyph is grid-fitted, the point numbers will be unchanged
	but the actual location of that point in the coordinate grid
	may have shifted. That is, the coordinates for a given point
	number will, very likely, have changed after a glyph is
	grid-fitted.</para>
      <bridgehead>What are instructions?</bridgehead>
      <para>The TrueType instruction set provides a large number of
	commands designed to allow designers to specify how character
	features should be rendered. Instructions are the mechanism by
	which the design of a character is preserved when it is
	scaled. In other words, instructions control the way in which
	a glyph outline will be grid-fitted for a particular size or
	device.</para>
      <para>Instructing a font will reshape the outline for a given
	glyph at a specific size on a given target device in such a
	way that the correct pixels are included within its
	outline. Reshaping the outline means moving outline
	points. Points that have been acted upon by an instruction are
	said to have been touched. Note that a point need not actually
	be moved to be touched. It must simply be acted upon by an
	instruction. (See MDAP, chapter 3.)</para>
      <para>TrueType fonts can be used with or without
	instructions. Uninstructed fonts will generally produce good
	quality results at sufficiently high resolutions and point
	sizes. The range of sizes over which an uninstructed font will
	produce good quality results depends not only on the output
	device resolution and point size of the character but also on
	the particular font design. The intended use of the font can
	also be a factor in determining whether or not a particular
	font should be instructed. For most fonts, if legibility of
	small point sizes on low resolution devices is important,
	adding instructions will be critical.</para>
      <para>Instructing a font is a process that involves analyzing
	the key elements of a glyph's design and using the TrueType
	instruction set to ensure that they are preserved. The
	instructions are flexible enough to allow characteristics that
	are roughly the same to be "homogenized" at small sizes while
	allowing the full flavor of the original design to emerge at
	sizes where there are sufficiently many pixels.</para>
      <para>How does the TrueType interpreter know the manner in
	which an outline should be distorted to produce a desirable
	result? This information is contained in instructions attached
	to each character in the font. Instructions specify aspects of
	a character's design that are to be preserved as it is
	scaled. For example, using instructions it is possible to
	control the height of an individual character or of all the
	characters in a font. You can also preserve the relationship
	between design elements within a character thereby ensuring,

      <para>The following figure illustrates how changing a glyph's
	outline at a specific size will yield a superior result. They
	show that an uninstructed 9 point Arial lowercase m suffers
	the loss of a stem due to chance effects in the relationship
	of stems to pixel centers. In the second glyph, instructions
	have aligned the stems to the grid so that the glyph suffers
	no similar loss.</para>

      <bridgehead>The TrueType interpreter</bridgehead>
      <para>This section describes the actions of the TrueType
	interpreter. It is the interpreter, as the name suggests, that
	"interprets" or carries out the instructions.</para>
      <para>More concretely, the interpreter processes a stream or
	sequence of instructions. Typically these instructions take
	their arguments from the interpreter stack and place their
	results on that stack. The only exceptions are a small number
	of instructions that are used to push data onto the
	interpreter stack. These instructions take their arguments
	from the instruction stream.</para>
      <para>All of the interpreter's actions are carried on in the
	context of the Graphics State, a set of variables whose values
	guide the actions of the interpreter and determine the exact
	effect of a particular instruction.</para>
      <para>The interpreter's actions can be summarized as follows:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The interpreter fetches an instruction from the
	    instruction stream, an ordered sequence of instruction
	    opcodes and data. Opcodes are 1-byte in size. Data can
	    consist of a single byte or two bytes (a word). If an
	    instruction takes words from the instruction stream it
	    will create those words by putting together two bytes. The
	    high byte appears first in the instruction stream and the
	    low byte appears second.</para>
          <para>The following instruction stream is depicted as it
	    will be shown in the examples that follow. Note that the
	    pointer indicates the next instruction to be executed.</para>

      <bridgehead>Using instructions</bridgehead>
      <para>Instructions can appear in a number of places in the
	font file tables that make up a TrueType font. They can appear
	as part of the Font Program, the CVT Program, or as glyph
	data. Instructions appearing in the first two apply to the
	font as a whole. Those found in glyph data
	(<ottable>glyf</ottable>) apply to individual glyphs within a
	font.</para>
      <bridgehead>The Font Program</bridgehead>
      <para>The Font Program consists of a set of instructions that
	is executed once, the first time a font is accessed by an
	application. It is used to create function definitions (FDEFs)
	and instruction definitions (IDEFs). Functions and
	instructions defined in the Font Program can be used elsewhere
	in the font file.</para>
      <bridgehead>The CVT Program</bridgehead>
      <para>The CVT Program is a sequence of TrueType instructions
	executed every time the point size or transformation
	change. It is used to make font wide changes rather than to
	manage individual glyphs. The CVT Program is used to establish
	the values in the Control Value Table.</para>
      <para>The purpose of the Control Value Table or CVT is to
	simplify the task of maintaining consistency when instructing
	a font. It is a numbered list of values that can be referenced
	by either of two indirect instructions (MIRP and MIAP). CVT
	entries can be used to store values that need to be the same
	across a number of glyphs in a font. For example an
	instruction might refer to a CVT entry whose purpose is to
	regularize stem weights across a font.</para>

    <title>The scan converter</title>

    <section role="specification">
      <title>Specification</title>
      <para>The TrueType scan converter takes an outline description
	of a glyph and produces a bitmap image for that glyph.</para>
      <para>The TrueType scan converter offers two modes. In the
	first mode, the scan converter uses a simple algorithm for
	determining which pixels are part of that glyph. The rules can
	be stated as follows:</para>
      <para>Rule 1: If a pixel's center falls within the glyph
	outline, that pixel is turned on and becomes part of that
	glyph.</para>
      <para>Rule 2: If a contour falls exactly on a pixel's center,
	that pixel is turned on.</para>
      <para>A point is considered to be an interior point of a glyph
	if it has a non-zero winding number. The winding number is
	itself determined by drawing a ray from the point in question
	toward infinity. (The direction in which the ray points in
	unimportant.) Starting with a count of zero, we subtract one
	each time a glyph contour crosses the ray from right to left
	or bottom to top. Such a crossing is termed an on
	transition. We add one each time a contour of the glyph
	crossed the ray from left to right or top to bottom. Such a
	crossing is termed an off transition. If the final count is
	non-zero, the point is an interior point.</para>
      <para>The direction of a contour can be determined by looking
	at the point numbers. The direction is always from lower point
	number toward higher point number.</para>
      <para>The illustration that follows demonstrates the use of
	winding numbers in determining whether a point is inside a
	glyph. The point p1 undergoes a sequence of four transitions
	(on transition, off transition, on transition, off
	transition). Since the sequence is even, the winding number is
	zero and the point is not inside the glyph. The second point,
	p2, undergoes an off transition followed by an on transition
	followed by an off transition yielding a winding number of
	+1. The point is in the interior of the glyph.</para>

      <bridgehead>What is a dropout?</bridgehead>

	connected by a straight line that only passes through black
	pixels.</para>

      <bridgehead>Preventing dropouts</bridgehead>
      <para>The TrueType instructions are designed to allow you to
	gridfit a glyph so that the desired pixels will be turned on
	by the simple scan converter regardless of the point size or
	the transformation used. It may prove difficult to foresee all
	possible transformations that a glyph might undergo. It is
	therefore difficult to instruct a glyph to ensure that the
	proper grid-fitting distortion of the outline will take place
	for every desired transformation. This problem is especially
	difficult for very small numbers of pixels per em and for
	complex typefaces. In these situations, some renditions of a
	glyph may contain dropouts.</para>
      <para>It is possible to test for potential dropouts by looking
	at an imaginary line segment connecting two adjacent pixel
	centers. If this line segment is intersected by both an
	on-Transition contour and an off-Transition contour, a
	potential dropout condition exists. The potential dropout only
	becomes an actual dropout if the two contour lines continue on
	in both directions to cut other line segments between adjacent
	pixel centers. If the two contours join together immediately
	after crossing a scan line (forming a stub), a dropout does
	not occur, although a stem of the glyph may become shorter
	than desired.</para>
      <para>To prevent dropouts, type manufacturers can choose to
	have the scan converter use two additional rules:</para>
      <para>Rule 3: If a scan line between two adjacent pixel centers (either
	vertical or horizontal) is intersected by both an
	on-Transition contour and an off-Transition contour and
	neither of the pixels was already turned on by rules 1 and 2,
	turn on the left-most pixel (horizontal scan line) or the
	bottom-most pixel (vertical scan line) </para>
      <para>Rule 4: Apply Rule 3 only if the two contours continue
	to intersect other scan lines in both directions. That is do
	not turn on pixels for 'stubs'. The scanline segments that
	form a square with the intersected scan line segment are
	examined to verify that they are intersected by two
	contours. It is possible that these could be different
	contours than the ones intersecting the dropout scan line
	segment. This is very unlikely but may have to be controlled
	with grid-fitting in some exotic glyphs.</para>
      <para>The type manufacturer can choose to use the simple scan
	converter employing rules 1 and 2 only or may optionally
	invoke either rule 3 or rule 4. The decision about which scan
	converter to use can be made on a font wide basis or a
	different choice can be specified for each glyph. The
	selection made in the preProgram will be the default for the
	entire font. A change made to the default in the instructions
	for an individual glyph will apply only to that glyph. </para>
